.# Azure Sentinel Detection Engineering

Detection engineering on a live Microsoft Sentinel and Defender XDR environment I operate. Nine custom analytics rules span three planes, each mapped to MITRE ATT&CK and proven end to end: a controlled action triggers the rule, the rule raises an incident, and the incident gets investigated and documented. Seven watch the Azure **control plane** (`AzureActivity`), including a multi-stage correlation and an ARG-backed content rule; one watches the **endpoint** (Defender for Endpoint), with Defender Vulnerability Management feeding a hunting library; one watches **identity** (Entra ID `SigninLogs`). All deployed by the same PR-gated pipeline.

> Figures are traceable: coverage to the [ATT&CK layer](navigator/coverage-layer.json), validation to [RESULTS.md](validation/RESULTS.md). There is deliberately **no false-positive-rate badge**: a single-tenant environment cannot produce a meaningful FP rate, so the repo reports measured false fires over a real benign batch instead of a fabricated percentage ([metrics.yaml](detections/metrics.yaml) states this in full).

---

## Quick start

**Run the detection unit tests on a fork, no Azure needed.** Each rule's real KQL runs against synthetic fixtures in a local Kusto emulator, so the detection logic is verifiable without my tenant:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibondarenko1/azure-sentinel-detection-engineering
cd azure-sentinel-detection-engineering
docker run -d --rm -p 8080:8080 -e ACCEPT_EULA=Y mcr.microsoft.com/azuredataexplorer/kustainer-linux:latest
pip install pyyaml
python tests/run-detection-tests.py
```

This is the exact check CI runs on every pull request ([detection-tests](.github/workflows/detection-tests.yml)): it asserts each rule fires on malicious fixtures and stays silent on benign ones. The live harness in [validation/](validation/) goes further, driving a real benign and attack batch in a tenant and measuring true positives and false fires, but that one needs your own Azure subscription and `az login` (see [validation/README](validation/README.md)), so it is not "local". Deployment pipeline: [docs/03](docs/03-cicd.md). Contributing a rule: [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Why this exists

A detection is only credible once you can show it firing. This repo closes that loop across three planes, the Azure control plane, the endpoint, and identity: rule logic, controlled trigger, generated incident, investigation, and MITRE mapping. It goes past single-event rules with a multi-stage correlation (grant then deploy) and a content-aware rule that joins Azure Resource Graph posture to the change event. It is Sentinel analytics rules, KQL, and incident response against real telemetry rather than synthetic samples.

## Detection-as-Code

The rules are not clicked into the portal. They are **versioned YAML deployed by a PR-gated pipeline**. Editing a detection means opening a pull request; CI validates it, a reviewer approves, and merge to `main` deploys it to Sentinel via **OIDC (no stored secrets)**, idempotently by rule GUID (API `2025-09-01`).

A real change went through it: [PR #1](https://github.com/ibondarenko1/azure-sentinel-detection-engineering/pull/1) tightened the DET-001 threshold (10 to 8); CI validated it, and the merge deployed it to the live `sc200-ws` rule. That step, rules deploying automatically from git by reviewed PR, is what separates a detection **engineer** from an analyst who finished a course.

## Results

Each detection was triggered with a controlled, self-reverted administrative action and produced a real incident:

![Incidents queue](screenshots/05-incidents-queue-populated.png)

Current operational state of the workspace: 10 analytics rules enabled, 4 active data connectors, an automation rule, and live data flowing. The 10 enabled rules are the nine custom `[DET]` scheduled rules in this catalog plus Microsoft's built-in Fusion rule (Advanced Multistage Attack Detection), which is on by default and not authored here; the nine figure elsewhere in this README counts the custom rules only.

![Microsoft Sentinel overview, current state](screenshots/11-sentinel-overview.png)

Five incidents are written up as full investigations:
- [INV-01, Mass resource deletion (High)](investigations/INV-01-mass-resource-deletion.md)
- [INV-02, RBAC privilege escalation](investigations/INV-02-rbac-privilege-escalation.md)
- [INV-03, LSASS credential access (High)](investigations/INV-03-lsass-credential-access.md), endpoint, Incident #65
- [INV-04, NSG opened inbound from Any (High)](investigations/INV-04-nsg-opened-inbound.md), ARG content correlation (DET-009)
- [INV-05, Privilege grant then deployment (High)](investigations/INV-05-grant-then-deploy.md), multi-stage correlation (DET-007)

Beyond one-off triggers, a [validation harness](validation/) drives a real **benign + attack** batch in the tenant and runs each rule's KQL against it, so false positives are **measured, not assumed**. Latest run ([results](validation/RESULTS.md)): 5/5 attack scenarios fired (DET-002/003/004/007/009) and 0 false fires on the benign stream (allow-listed owner deploy, sub-threshold deletes, deploy-without-grant). It does not fake production volume; it converts "0% FP at N=1" into a measured "0 false fires over a real benign batch".

## ATT&CK coverage

A coverage map with explicit gaps is more honest than a list of rules. The [ATT&CK Navigator layer](navigator/coverage-layer.json) ([how to load](navigator/README.md)) shows both:

| Covered (deployed rule) | Known gap, tracked as an issue |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| T1087 Account Discovery (DET-001) | [T1530 Data from Cloud Storage](../../issues/12), data-plane detection |
| T1562.007 Disable/Modify Cloud Firewall (DET-002 / DET-009) | [T1496 Resource Hijacking](../../issues/13), spend/mining anomaly |
| T1098 Account Manipulation (DET-003 / DET-005 / DET-007) | [T1526 Cloud Service Discovery](../../issues/14), strengthen heuristic |
| T1485 Data Destruction (DET-004) | |
| T1003.001 LSASS Memory (DET-006) | |
| T1110 Brute Force / T1078 Valid Accounts (DET-008) | |

The gaps are not static text. Each one is a live [`detection-gap` issue](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Adetection-gap), so the roadmap is a clickable backlog.

**Why these rules and not others:** [docs/08, detection strategy and threat model](docs/08-detection-strategy.md) maps the catalog to a cloud kill chain and risk-ranks the gaps. **How a rule gets tuned:** [docs/09, a measured DET-005 tuning loop](docs/09-tuning-case-study.md) takes a rule from "fires on every write" to a measured zero false positives on the validation harness.

## Automated response (SOAR)

The highest-severity detection closes the loop from detect to respond. A Sentinel automation rule runs a [Logic App playbook](playbooks/mass-deletion-response) on every DET-004 (mass deletion) incident: it posts an enrichment comment with the recommended containment (disable the caller, lock the resource groups, restore, hunt). The playbook authenticates with its own **managed identity** straight to the ARM API, with no secrets and no external connector.

A second playbook extends the loop into **detect → respond → AI-investigate** with **Microsoft Security Copilot**: a [promptbook + Logic App](playbooks/copilot-triage) invokes a Copilot promptbook on the same DET-004 incident and posts an AI investigation summary as a comment. It is built and deploys without any compute units; the live AI-summary capture runs in a single cost-bounded (~$4) paid window and is not claimed until captured. Cost and teardown runbook: [docs/06](docs/06-security-copilot.md).

## Endpoint and vulnerability management

The detections start on the Azure control plane; this phase adds the endpoint plane. A Defender for Endpoint sensor on a Windows host feeds the same workspace, so the Detection-as-Code pipeline deploys an endpoint rule, [DET-006 LSASS credential access](detections/DET-006-lsass-credential-access.md), next to the control-plane rules. DET-006 is multi-source and witnessed: three credential-dump techniques were run against the sensor, the hardened host (LSASS RunAsPPL, AMSI, behavioral protection) prevented every one, and the rule fired on the resulting Defender alerts to raise an incident ([INV-03](investigations/INV-03-lsass-credential-access.md)). Defender Vulnerability Management adds a second input: a [hunting library](kql/hunting) that surfaces critical CVEs by exposed software, failed secure-configuration baselines, and vulnerable assets under active alert. The `DeviceTvm*` tables live only in Defender advanced hunting, so those correlations are hunts, not deployed rules, and the repo says where each query actually runs. Architecture and data flow: [docs/07](docs/07-endpoint-vulnerability-management.md).

## Posture remediation

The detections watch for attacks; this phase reads the tenant's own posture score and fixes what it
flags, then proves the number moved. The Defender for Cloud Secure Score baseline is pulled as a
[machine-readable snapshot](posture/snapshots/2026-06-10-baseline.json) by [collect-posture.ps1](posture/collect-posture.ps1),
so the before/after is a file diff, not a screenshot comparison. At baseline the score is **68.81%**
(21.33 / 31), and the per-control breakdown puts the entire 9.67-point gap in four controls
(encryption at rest, access and permissions, network access, auditing). The remediation is ordered by
blast radius, additive fixes first, and each item is mapped to the catalog rule that catches its
regression (storage exposure to DET-002 / DET-009, RBAC sprawl to DET-003 / DET-007, lost logging to
the whole catalog). Three fixes were applied this pass and verified at the resource level: the
security contact and alert notifications, diagnostic logging on both SOAR playbooks (+1 auditing),
and encryption at host on the sensor VM (+4 encryption at rest). Defender for Cloud re-evaluates and
recalculates the score over the following 24 to 72 hours, so the after-score is documented as a
follow-up rather than asserted now. Full method, ordered plan, and detection-linkage table:
[docs/10, posture remediation](docs/10-posture-remediation.md).

## SOC 2 control mapping

This work supports a recognized control framework, so the repo says where. Each part of the catalog
maps to a SOC 2 Trust Services Criterion: the nine-rule catalog and incidents to the monitor-and-respond
series (CC7.2 to CC7.4), the SOAR playbooks to incident response (CC7.4), the PR-gated Detection-as-Code
pipeline to change management (CC8.1), and the validation harness and posture before-and-after to control
operating effectiveness (CC4.1). It is framed as a mapping, not a compliance claim: this is one tenant I
operate, not an audited organization, so the document maps the technical control activities and is
explicit about the governance wrapper a real SOC 2 report needs that a detection repo does not carry.

## Contributing

This is a personal portfolio, but it is structured so a detection change is a reviewable pull request, not a portal click. If you fork it or want to propose a rule, [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers the workflow: edit the rule YAML, regenerate the KQL mirror, extend the test fixture, run the unit tests locally, and open a PR that the same CI gates check.
